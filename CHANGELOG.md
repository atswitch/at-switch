## [Unreleased]

## [v3.15.2] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- Tencent ima model switching on macOS and Windows through its signed-in account model settings, limited to public OpenAI Chat Completions endpoints.
- Account-scoped encrypted recovery checkpoints, two-scene selection verification, interruption recovery, and preservation of existing custom models and unrelated local settings.

### Validation
- The macOS account round trip covers original model → third-party model → repeated switch → original model → third-party model → final restoration without creating duplicate model rows.
- Frontend, Rust, formatting, Clippy, dependency-license, and existing-Agent regression gates pass. Windows implementation is covered by static and unit checks but still requires device validation.

## [v3.15.1] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed
- DuMate switching now verifies every native model alias in the effective account override, preventing a stale route from being reported as successfully applied.
- The settings footer now reads the packaged application version and current runtime platform instead of showing a stale hard-coded version and both platforms.
- macOS release builds now require a complete Developer ID signing configuration and remain draft-only until signature, notarization, and clean-machine checks are complete.

## [v3.14.2] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- Baidu DuMate detection and model switching on macOS and Windows.
- Account-scoped `opencode.jsonc` overrides that persist across restarts, including default models, small models, and native aliases used by existing conversations and artifact validation.
- Restoration of original DuMate configuration while preserving unrelated user settings and custom providers.

### Usage
- Sign in to DuMate and open its coding agent once before refreshing Agent status.
- Direct mode requires OpenAI Chat Completions. Use the local proxy for other upstream protocols.
- Windows x64 and macOS Universal installers are identical on the official website and GitHub Releases, with published SHA-256 checksums.

## [v3.14.1] - 2026-09-04

  - Seamless bidirectional translation across OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, and Anthropic Messages.
  - SSE streaming and Tool Calling / Function Calling compatibility layer.
- **Security & Privacy**:
  - OS-native credential storage via macOS Keychain and Windows Credential Manager.
  - Zero plain-text persistence of API keys in application databases.
