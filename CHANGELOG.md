## [v3.14.2] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- Baidu DuMate detection and model switching on macOS and Windows.
- Account-scoped `opencode.jsonc` overrides that persist across restarts, including default models, small models, and native aliases used by existing conversations and artifact validation.
- Restoration of original DuMate configuration while preserving unrelated user settings and custom providers.

### Usage
- Sign in to DuMate and open its coding agent once before refreshing Agent status.
- Direct mode requires OpenAI Chat Completions. Use the local proxy for other upstream protocols.
- Windows x64 and macOS Universal installers are identical on the official website and GitHub Releases, with published SHA-256 checksums.
